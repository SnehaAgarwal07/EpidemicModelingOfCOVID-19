# EpidemicModelingOfCOVID-19
Fitted the SIR model on existing data and predicted cases for the next 90 days with and without using intervention
The MCMC inference algorithm was used to learn the various parameters such as beta(Transmission Rate), gamma(Recovery Rate) and delta(rate at which beta changes)
Predicted cases in each of the 3 categories(Susceptible, Infected, Resistant) after intervention on parameters like beta, gamma and delta and also using counterfactuals.

Intervention 1:
